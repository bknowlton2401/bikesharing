# Bikesharing
Using Tableau to research bike sharing in Des Moines, IA

## Overview of anaylsis
The purpose of this project is to use Tableau to research how bikesharing is used in New York City for comparison of how it could be implemented in Des Moines, IA.  I used data from Citi Bikes to show a breakdown of peak times, top starting and ending locations, subscribers vs non-subscribers and a beakdown by gender.

### Peak hours of operation
This data is useful to determine when more bikes are needed and to know when to do maintenance.

### Top starting and ending locations
The top starting and ending locations are centered around other commuter terminals, such as ferries or subway stations.
